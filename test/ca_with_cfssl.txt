To initalize Certificate Authority (CA) and generate certs we need a config file containing general config info about our CA. 

ca-csr.json
cfssl will use this file to configure our CA's certs. 
- CN == common name 
- key == specific algorithm and size of key to sign the certificate with.
- names == list of various name information that'll be added to cert:
  - C - country
  - L = locality or city
  - ST - state or province
  - O - organization name
  - OU - organizational unit (dept responsible for owning the key)

  ca-config.json:
  CA needs to know what kind of certificates it will issue.
  - Signing == defines the CA's signing policy
    - config file dictates that the CA can generate client and server certificates that will expire after a year and the certificates may be used for digital signatures, encrypting keys and auth. 

    server-csr.json:
    cfssl will use these configs to configure our server's certificate.
    - "hosts" == list of the domain names that the certificate should be valid for


Update MAKEFILE:
Added CONFIG_PATH variable to specify where we'd want to put our generated certificates and an init target to create that directory.
- gencert - calls cfssl to generate the certificate and private keys for our CA and server using the config files above.
